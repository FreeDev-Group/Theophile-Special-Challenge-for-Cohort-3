Hi team

here is a simple **test report template** we can start using.

The idea is NOT that this is the perfect or final model, but just a **practical guide** to help us:

- capture what we observe while testing (in real time),
- focus on what is not normal (vs the use case or what is undefined),
- and make it easier to track and understand issues.

It is not exhaustive, and we are absolutely free to improve it as we learn.

Let’s use it, experiment with it, break it if needed, and share what works better.

# TEST NOTES (Live Testing)

> I document my observations **as I test**, not after.  
> I focus on what is **not normal**, meaning:
>
> - What does NOT match the documented use case
> - What is NOT defined in the use case but happens anyway

---

## What I am testing

I am testing:

> (Example: Create Account with valid email and password)

---

## What I did (steps)

I describe exactly what I did so someone else can @@reproduce it.

1. I opened the application
2. I clicked on “Create Account”
3. I entered:
   - Email: test@email.com
   - Password: 123456
4. I clicked “Submit”

---

## What I noticed (IMPORTANT)

I write here **anything that feels wrong, unexpected, or unclear**.

> Example:
>
> - Nothing happened after clicking “Submit”
> - No confirmation message
> - I don’t know if the account was created

---

## What should have happened

Based on the use case (or common sense):

> Example:
>
> - I should be redirected  
>   OR
> - I should see a success message

---

## Is this a problem?

If YES, I describe it clearly:

- **Short description:**

  > Example: “Submit button does nothing”

- **Why this is a problem:**

  > It does not match the expected behavior in the use case

- **Type:** Bug / UX / Missing behavior

- **Severity (my opinion):** Low / Medium / High

---

## Special note (VERY IMPORTANT)

I explicitly note:

- If something expected is missing
- If something happens but is NOT described in the use case

> Example:  
> “There is no error message when the form is invalid (not mentioned in the use case either)”

---

## Evidence

- I add screenshots when needed
- I make sure the issue is visible in context

---

## My thoughts / questions

- What confused me
- What I don’t understand
- Ideas for improvement

> Example:  
> “As a new user, I don’t know what to do next”

---

## Action taken

- I created a sub-issue
- I added the "bug" label
- I continued testing
